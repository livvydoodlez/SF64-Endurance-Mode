About:

Endurance mode is a mode custom maded to have a set timer to beat a level. The timer is very short, and the only way to gain more time is to earn points. Once the timer reaches zero, the player will explode, and the level will start over. There are no checkpoints available.

  1. Timer for levels [Done & Tested]
  2. Timer adds up to minutes [Done & Tested]
  3. Add points per a kill = [Done & Tested]
  4. Subtract points per HP loss = [Done & Tested]
